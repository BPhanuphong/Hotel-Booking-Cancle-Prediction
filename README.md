# Traditional Machine Learning and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) Performance comparison on Binary Classification Data Set Study

## Executive Summary:
-
-

## Introduction:
- The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of tuned models between traditional Machine Learning Models (using scikit-learn and Grid Search to tune) and deep learning in MLP model (using TensorFlow and tuned dense layer, epoch, batch size, batch normalization, regularization) on tabular dataset.
- Use Hotel Booking Demand data set to predict booking cancellations in binary classification. (0: cancel, 1: not cancel)
- Tranditional Model: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost Calssifiter.
