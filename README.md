# Traditional Machine Learning and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) Performance comparison on Binary Classification Data Set Study

## Executive Summary:
- The traditional ML model performs classification better than the deep learning model in both accuracy score (+6%) and training time (-641%).
- Oversampling helps improve model training in the imbalanced dataset.
## Introduction:
  This project aims to compare the performance of various traditional Machine Learning Models using scikit-learn algorithms and Deep Learning models using TensorFlow on 5 different classification datasets including binary and multiclass classification. The classification performance was evaluated by Accuracy score and training time used for each model.
